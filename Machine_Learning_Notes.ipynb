    "1. The study of computer programs (algorithms) that can learn by example\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ML algorithms can generalize from existing examples of a task\n",
    "    - e.g. after seeing a training set of labeled images, an image classifier can figure out how to apply labels accurately to new, previously unseen images\n",

    "## Machine Learning models can learn by example\n",
    "1. Algorithms learn rules from `labelled examples`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A set of labelled examples used for learning is called `training data`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The learned rules should also be able to `generalize` to correctly recognize or predict new examples not in the traning set.\n",
