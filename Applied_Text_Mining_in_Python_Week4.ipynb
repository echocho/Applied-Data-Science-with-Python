    "## Semantic Text Similarity\n",
    "### Applications of semantic similarity\n",
    "1. Grouping similar words into semantic concepts\n",
    "2. As a building block in natural language understanding tasks\n",
    "    - Textual entailment\n",
    "    - Paraphrasing\n",
    "\n",
    "### WordNet\n",
    "1. Semantic dictionary of (mostly) English words, interlinked by semantic relations\n",
    "2. Includes rich linguistic information\n",
    "    - part of speech, word senses, synonyms, hypernyms, meronyms, derivationally related forms, ...\n",
    "3. Machine-readable, freely available\n",
    "\n",
    "### Semantic similary using WordNet\n",
    "1. Wordnet organizes information in a hierarchy\n",
    "2. Many similarity measures use the hierarchy in some way\n",
    "3. Verbs, nouns, adjectives all have separate hierarchies\n",
    "For example,\n",

    "### Path Similarity\n",
    "1. Find the shortest path between the two concepts\n",
    "2. Similarity measure inversely related to path distance\n",
    "    - PathSim(deer, elk) = 1/1+distance = 1/(1+1) = 0.5\n",
    "    - PathSim(deer, giraffe) = 1/(1+1+1) = 0.33\n",
    "    - PathSim(deer, horse) = 1/7 = 0.14 \n",
    "\n",
    "### Lowest Common Subsumer (LCS)\n",
    "1. Find the closest ancestor to both concepts\n",
    "    - LCS(deer, elk) = deer\n",
    "    - LCS(deer, giraffe) = ruminant\n",
    "    - LCS(deer, horse) = ungulate\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Lin Similarity\n",
    "1. Similarity measure based on the information contained in the LCS of the two concepts\n",
    "    - LinSim(u,v) = 2 * logP(LCS(u,v)) /logP(u) + logP(V))\n",
    "2. P(u) is given by the information content learnt over a large corpus\n",

    "### Collcations and Disributional similarity\n",
    "1. \"You know a word by the company it keeps\"\n",
    "2. Two words that frequently appear in similar contexts are more likely to be semantically related. \n",
    "    e.g. \n",
    "    - The friends met at a cafe (met, at, a)\n",
    "    - Shayne met Ray at a pizzeria (met, at, a)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distributional Similarity: Context\n",
    "1. Words before, after, within a small window\n",
    "2. Parts of speech of words before, after, in a small window\n",
    "3. Specific syntactic relation to the target word\n",
    "4. Words in the same sentence, same document, ..\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strength of association between words\n",
    "1. Not similar if two words don't occur together often\n",
    "2. Also important to see how frequent are individual words\n",
    "    - e.g. \"the\"\n",
    "3. Pointwise Mutual Information \n",
    "    **PMI(w,c) = log[P(w,c)/P(w)P(c)]**\n",
