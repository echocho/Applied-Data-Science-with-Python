    "## Network Definition and Vocabulary\n",
    "Network (Graph): A representation of connections among a set of items\n",
    "    - Items are called nodes (or vertices)\n",
    "    - Connections are called edges (or link or ties)\n",
    "    <img src=\"https://img.ceclinux.org/ae/5f67db0c9b105ea28d7208507eff7d767e38a6.png\">\n",
    "```python3\n",
    "import networkx as nx\n",
    "G = nx.Graph()\n",
    "G.add_edge('A', 'B')\n",
    "G.add_edge('B', 'C')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of networks: \n",
    "1. symmetry relationships \n",
    "    - nodes: people; edges: friendship, marital, family trees\n",
    "2. aymmetric relationships\n",
    "    - nodes: birds; edges: what eats what\n",
    "\n",
    "### Edge Direction\n",
    "1. Undirected network\n",
    "    - <img src=\"https://img.ceclinux.org/50/c284c8c2b4d66c3e593da0e1d713c4c75fa624.png\">\n",

    "\n",
    "### Weighted Networks\n",
    "1. a network where edges are assigned a (typically numerical) weight\n",
    "2. Not all relationships are equal\n",
    "3. Some edges carry higher weight than others\n",
    "4. <img src=\"https://img.ceclinux.org/cf/e669ec3577457f8c1ecd86c7021ce31f295662.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Signed Networks\n",
    "A network where edges are assigned positive or negative sign. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Some networks can carry information about friendship and antagonism based on conflict or disagreement.\n",
    "    - e.g. in Epinions and Slashdot people can declare both friends and foes.\n",

    "    G.add_edge('B', 'C', sign='-')\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Edge Attributes\n",
    "Edges can carry many other labels or attributes \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://img.ceclinux.org/07/3cec506abedeb88f9883344c23e871d93facc6.png\">\n",
